<p>We in the P2 group believe that network routing and distributed query
processing are intimately connected activities. </p>

<P>Overlay networks are used today in a variety of distributed systems
ranging from file-sharing and storage systems to communication
infrastructures.  However, designing, building and adapting these
overlays to the intended application and the target environment is a
difficult and time consuming process.

<P>To ease the development and the deployment of such overlay networks,
we have implemented P2, a system which uses a declarative logic
language to express the overlay networks in a highly compact and
reusable form. P2 can express a Narada-style mesh network in
12 rules, and the Chord structured overlay in only
36 rules.  P2 directly parses and executes such
specifications using a dataflow architecture to construct and maintain
the overlay networks.  We describe the P2 approach, how our
implementation works, and show by experiment that the performance of
P2 overlays is acceptable.
