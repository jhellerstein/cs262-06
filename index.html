<p>CS262a is an introductory graduate course on computer systems
research, including operating systems, database systems, and internet
infrastructure systems.&nbsp; The goal of the course is to cover a
broad array of research topics in computer systems, and to engage students
in top-flight systems research. A central aspect of the course is to
consider key research themes in computer systems from multiple
perspectives; to this end the course is team-taught by faculty from
two different software systems disciplines.  The class is based on
lively discussion of important papers from the literature, and a research
project.</p>
