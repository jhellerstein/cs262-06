<h2>Introduction to Transactions</h2>
</center>
<h3>
Quick History</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
Some of the old hierarchical and network DBs had pretty clever systems
for handling reliability.&nbsp; BUT -- they had no formalisms to
describe
the semantics clearly, and hence few lessons to transfer to other
systems.</li>
  <li>
System R's RSS team, led by Jim Gray, codified the formal notion of <i>transactions
    </i>and
    <i>serializability,
    </i>and System R delivered a working (though inefficient)
implementation.&nbsp;
Led to 1998 Turing Award for Gray.</li>
  <li>
Our own Christos Papadimitriou did early work formalizing theoretical
results
on transactions (and has a book on the topic!)</li>
  <li>
Various companies slogged through the details of transactions over the
years, especially the complex issues of logging and recovery.&nbsp; In
the 80's and into the 90's, IBM published papers on ARIES, which is the
classic discussion of the dirty details of logging and recover.&nbsp;
Many
industry vets "already knew" this stuff and had done it in commercial
systems.</li>
  <li>
There is an entire industry of Transaction Processing that exists
outside
of DBs, and related to distributed applications and services.&nbsp;
More
on this later in the semester.</li>
  <li>
Generally a field populated by industrial practitioners!</li>
  <li>
Since the early days, academic work has focused largely on esoteric
issues
of extensions to the flat transaction model.&nbsp; Little of this has
found
practical use.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Background</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
Transactions are concepts that allow a system to guarantee certain
semantic
properties.</li>
  <li>
These guarantees must be rigorously defined so that people can build
correct
systems above them.</li>
  <li>
Theory meets practice here in a nice way.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Kinds of Actions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Unprotected actions</b>: you cannot count on these.&nbsp; It is
the
responsibility of higher level actions to check on these if they want
to
be sure.</li>
  <li>
    <b>Protected actions:</b> actions enclosed inside of transactions.</li>
  <li>
    <b>Real actions:</b> actions that are visible outside the
computer.&nbsp;
Print to screen, send a web page, output money, drill hole, fire
missile,
etc.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>
getting these right is very tricky!</li>
    <li>
easier if <i>idempotent</i> (a la "drill hole")</li>
    <li>
doable but tricky if you can check the state of the real world
somehow.&nbsp;
we'll return to this later if we get to talk about transactional
networking.</li>
    <li>
otherwise impossible to handle!</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h3>
A.C.I.D.</h3>
A transaction should enjoy the following guarantees:
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>A</b>tomicity: the "all or nothing" property.&nbsp; Programmer
needn't
worry about partial states persisting.</li>
  <li>
    <b>C</b>onsistency: the database should start out "consistent", and
at
the end of transaction remain "consistent".&nbsp; The definition of
"consistent"
is up to the database administrator to define to the system; other
notions
of consistency must be handled by the application.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>
Gray &amp; Reuter are <i>very</i> confusing on this point.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    <b>I</b>solation: a transaction should not see the effects of other
uncommitted
transactions.</li>
  <li>
    <b>D</b>urability: once committed, the transactions effects should
not
disappear (though they may be overwritten by subsequent commited
transactions).</li>
</ul>
Roughly speaking:<br>
<b>A</b> and <b>D </b>are guaranteed by <i>recovery</i> (usually
implemented
via logging)<i>.</i>
<br>
<b>C</b> and <b>I</b> are guaranteed by <i>concurrency control</i>
(usually implemented via locking).
<br>
<br>
It's worth noting that this is not a theoretical formalism, just a
mnemonic.&nbsp; Don't expect it to be a perfect factoring of the issues
-- there is overlap of concerns among the four.<br>
<h3>
Concurrency Control &amp; Serializability</h3>
CS186 material you might not know.
<ul>
  <li>
We want to allow multiple transactions to operate concurrently.&nbsp;
(Why?)</li>
  <li>
Need a crisp definition of acceptable and unacceptable concurrency</li>
  <ul>
    <li>
build that on a notion of acceptable <i>orders of operation</i></li>
    <li>
DB only understands simple data-oriented operations: read, write,
begin,
commit, abort</li>
    <li>
order of operations captured in a transaction schedule:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
transactions (<i>T<sub>i</sub></i>) and data objects (<i>a...z</i>)</li>
      <li>
all operations of a transactions occur in the order specified by the
transaction</li>
      <li>
schedule captures the interleaving of the operations in time</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
e.g. <i>R<sub>1</sub>(a), R<sub>2</sub>(a), W<sub>2</sub>(a), W<sub>1</sub>(a),</i></li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>
One reasonable definition of correct order of operation: <i>serial
schedules</i></li>
    <ul>
      <li>
rough defn: those schedules that have no interleaving of operations
across
xactions</li>
      <li>
        <i>note:</i> in this definition, <i>any </i>serial schedule
is correct
-- order of transactions isn't guaranteed in any way!</li>
    </ul>
    <li>
What we'd like</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
to get the effect of serial schedules, but still get lots of concurrency</li>
      <li>
        <i>serializable schedules</i> are those schedules that are
"equivalent"
to serial schedules</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
definition of equivalence: produces the same final state as a serial
schedule</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>
What could mess up serializability?</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>conflicts: </i>two transactions share a data item, and at
least one
writes it.&nbsp; In time, we have RW (unrepeatable read), WR (dirty
read),
and WW (lost write) conflicts.</li>
      <li>
These conflicts can be OK if you're careful!</li>
      <li>
Can draw a <i>serializability</i> graph (directed), where nodes are
transactions,
and edges are conflicts in order of time.</li>
      <li>
Definition: 2 schedules are <i>conflict equivalent</i> if they have
the
same actions, and each pair of conflicting actions is ordered the same
way.</li>
      <li>
Definition: a schedule is <i>conflict serializable</i> if it is
conflict
equivalent to a serial schedule.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
Note: some serializable schedules are <i>NOT</i> conflict serializable!</li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        <b>Theorem:</b> A schedule is conflict serializable if and only
if its
serializability graph is acyclic.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
Do you see the proof?</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>
Now we have a definition, and a way to be sure we're
serializable.&nbsp;
We need a <i>mechanism </i>to enforce serializability.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Two-Phase Locking (2PL)</b>: based on 3 rules</li>
    <ol>
      <li>
before reading an object, a transaction must get a shared lock on it</li>
      <li>
before writing an object, a xaction must get an exclusive lock on it</li>
      <li>
once a xaction releases one lock, it cannot request any more locks
(hence
the name 2PL)</li>
    </ol>
    <li>
      <b>Theorem:</b> 2PL ensures that the precedence graph generated
by transactions
will be acyclic -- so serializability is enforced.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
Can you see the proof here?</li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      <b>Strict 2PL</b> is a variant of 2PL in which a xaction must
drop all
its locks at once.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
has nice features: avoids "cascading aborts", and guarantees
"recoverable"
schedules.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h3>
Recovery</h3>
Just you wait!&nbsp; We will dig (deep) into this subject in subsequent
reading on ARIES.

Main mechanism used: <b>Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)</b></li>
