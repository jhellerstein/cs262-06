<p> Posterboard and gluespray are available from my grants administrator, Lauren Bailey, in 617 Soda.  This is not really her job, so be extra nice ;-)  You will need to use the gluespray somewhere non-toxic, i.e. not outside Lauren's door.  Please let Lauren know your name and email when you take it, and return it right after you're done.
</p>
<p> We will have easels ready for you at the poster session.</p>
<p> Good luck finishing up your projects!</p>
