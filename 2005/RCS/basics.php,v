by Hellerstein and Stonebraker.

<br>
An additional suggested text is Gray and Reuter's <a
 href="http://www.mkp.com/books_catalog/1-55860-190-2.asp"><i>
Transaction Processing: Concepts and Techniques</i></a>
</p>
<b>Prerequisites: </b>The basic prerequisite is to pass the <i>entrance
exam</i> in class.&nbsp;
It will cover undergraduate operating systems material at the level
of Berkeley's CS162, and will be pass/fail.&nbsp; It will not be
difficult if you've had an undergraduate course, though you may need to
"page
in" the material.&nbsp; The test will have no effect on your grade; it
is purely for admission, to ensure that everyone has a solid
foundation, and in turn a high level of discussion. &nbsp;The test is
on the second day of class, Thursday September 1.
<br><br>
<b> Exams, Papers, etc.</b>
<br>
The main work of this class is to read steadily and
deeply, while working toward a group research project of publishable
quality.&nbsp; Each student will be individually responsible for
writing up a short summary of every paper.  An <a href="examplewriteup.txt">example summary from 
a past year</a> (written by a distinguished alumnus) is available for reference.
<p>There will be one midterm exam (albeit near the end), and no final
exam. </p>
<p>Research projects are a critical aspect of the course.&nbsp; You
goal is
to do some quality systems research; that is, to add to our
understanding of how to build systems.&nbsp; Research projects must be
written up in a term paper, and will be presented in a poster in a
departmental mini-conference.&nbsp; Suggested project ideas will be
provided by the instructors, but you are strongly encouraged to come up
with your own project ideas.&nbsp; Potential projects include
implementation or analysis of some piece of an OS, a DBMS, or an
internet service; extending one of these systems with new
functionality; or measurement and analysis of existing systems with the
goal of better understanding issues in system design.
