<h1> Query Processing</h1>
 Themes: Dataflow and Dataflow Operators <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 
<h2> <b>A quick primer on the relational algebra</b></h2>
  
<ul>
 <li> selection</li>
  <li> projection</li>
  <li> cartesian product</li>
  <li> union</li>
  <li> difference</li>
  <li> join (in particular, theta-join)</li>
 
</ul>
  
<h2> Dataflow Architecture: Iterators</h2>
 Basic question: how do you turn the algebraic operator abstraction into a
programming construct?&nbsp; Iterators. 
<h3> An OO view of iterators:</h3>
 An iterator is a superclass for all dataflow operators.&nbsp; It has three 
methods: 
<ul>
 <li> open(): initialize state to set up dataflow.</li>
  <li> next(): produce a record as output</li>
  <li> close(): clean up state</li>
 
</ul>
 The output type of next() is well typed.&nbsp; In a SQL system, this is a
SQL record in some schema, e.g. (integer, numeric(10,2), varchar, float). 
<p>Iterators are strung together into a dataflow by parameterizing them to
have other iterators as inputs, and then having their methods invoke the
input iterators' methods.&nbsp; Usually parent.open() invokes child.open() 
and sometimes child.next().&nbsp; Usually parent.next() invokes child.next() 
or nothing.&nbsp; Usually parent.close() invokes child.close(). </p>
<p>An iterator also has a number of private data members, including all the
"input" iterators it invokes (usually one or two of these), and any state
it maintains.&nbsp; The types of the records from input iterators need to
match the operator semantics in generating the output type.&nbsp; In a DBMS,
this is all set up automatically at query parsing/optimization time.&nbsp;
Extensible "optimizer generators" have been developed that let you declare
these rules in a high-level way (not as optimizer code). </p>
<h3> A state-machine/event-handler view:</h3>
 An iterator is an event handler for the events open/next/close/tuple-received.&nbsp; 
The work in subclassing the iterator operator is to identify and maintain 
the states that it can be in across next() events. 
<p>An eventflow graph is constructed to string together the dataflow, and 
type matching of tuples needs to be managed as part of constructing that graph. 
<br>
&nbsp; </p>
<h3> A note on Synchronous/Asynchronous (a.k.a. Pull/Push)</h3>
 Typically, iterators in a single-site query processor make synchronous calls
to their children.&nbsp; This is a "pull" model, like sucking data through
a straw.&nbsp; For now, it's fine to think of iterators that way. 
<p>As we'll see later this semester, in some contexts it can be more efficient 
to "push" the data between iterators (e.g. if there's a network in between!).&nbsp; This means that tuples
arrive asynchronously.&nbsp; Some kind of buffering and/or rate-matching has
to happen to keep operators in sync. </p>
<h2> Typical DB Dataflow Operators</h2>
  
<h3> Unary Operations</h3>
  
<ul>
 <li> sorting: see Knuth, or Shapiro paper.  Then follow up at <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/barc/SortBenchmark/">Jim Gray's Sort Benchmark homepage</a>Uses?</li>
  <li> hashing: a minor variant of hybrid-hash join works well. Uses?</li>
 
</ul>
  
<h3> Binary Operations: Union</h3>
 Without duplicate elimination, a very simple iterator (SQL's "UNION ALL").&nbsp; 
Only issue is that both inputs have to have identical schemas. 
<p>With duplicate elimination (SQL's plain "UNION"), you need to eliminate 
duplicates too.&nbsp; Simple implementation: do UNION ALL as one iterator, 
and dup-elim as another; make sure to use them in order if somebody wants 
UNION without dups. </p>
<h3> Binary Operations: Join</h3>
 Join algorithms apply to almost any form of combining multiple collections, 
except for UNION. 
<p>Some commonly used join variants (alternative logical algebra operators): 
</p>
<ul>
 <li> semi-join: R semi-join S ~= R join remove-dups(S) projected to the
columns of R</li>
  
  <ul>
 <li> S basically serves as a filter</li>
  <li> logically, selection is a semijoin with an infinite relation (!!)</li>
 
  </ul>
  <li> outer join: R outer-join S: compute R join S, and for each tuple of
R that has no match send it to the output with the S columns filled in with
NULLs. Left, Right, and Full Outer Joins exist.&nbsp; Very common for web
apps.&nbsp; Some logical subtleties here (no longer commutative/associative).</li>
  <li> intersection &amp; difference</li>
 
</ul>
 These logical algebra operators can be implemented as minor variations on
the same join algorithms! 
<p>The "Guy Lohman Test" for join operators (a.k.a. pipelining of intermediate 
results): </p>
<ul>
 <li> does the operator work for joining 3 inputs without storing the output 
of 2 of the inputs?</li>
 
</ul>
 The "Joe Hellerstein Test" for join operators (a.k.a. full pipelining): 
<ul>
 <li> does the operator produce outputs before it finishes reading any of
its inputs?</li>
  <li> how quickly -- and are they the juicy outputs?</li>
 
</ul>
  
<h3> Nested Loops Join</h3>
  
<pre>for each tuple r of R<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for each tuple s of S<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if rs satisfies join predicate<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output rs</pre>
 R is the outer relation (left) 
<p>S is the inner relation (right) </p>
<ul>
 <li> works for any join predicate</li>
  <li> inner input must be stored</li>
 
</ul>
  
<h3> Refinement 1: Block Nested Loops Join</h3>
  
<pre>for each block BR of R<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for each tuple s of S<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for each tuple r of BR such that rs satisfies join predicate<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output rs</pre>
 Further refinements to nested loops: 
<ul>
 <li> load R in chunks of M-K pages to amortize seek cost, "pin" K pages
of the inner into memory</li>
  <li> alternate scan direction on inner ("boustrophedonism")</li>
 
</ul>
  
<h3> Refinement 2: Index Nested Loops Join</h3>
  
<pre>for each tuple r of R<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; probe index over S;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output all s s.t. rs satisfies join predicate;</pre>
 Notes: 
<ul>
 <li> Still called "nested loops", S is still referred to as the "inner"
relation</li>
  <li> any join predicate can be supported if the index supports the predicate!</li>
 
</ul>
  
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SELECT cities.name<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FROM cities, forests<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHERE cities.boundary overlaps forests.boundary;</pre>
  
<ul>
 <li> can convert all nested-loops joins to index-nested-loops by indexing
inner on the fly.&nbsp; usually not worth it.</li>
 
</ul>
  
<h3> (Sort-)Merge Join</h3>
 Works for equijoin, "band" joins 
<p>we will assume here you know how to do a 2-pass sort [see Knuth or Shapiro] 
</p>
<p>idea: if R &amp; S are sorted on the join column(s), we can "simply" merge
them </p>
<p>But duplicates complicate things (as usual). <br>

  </p>
<pre>sort R;<br>sort S;<br>R.open();<br>S.open();<br>r = R.next();<br>s = S.next();<br>while (r != NULL &amp;&amp; s != NULL) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while (r.c &lt; s.c)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; r = R.next();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (r.c = s.c) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while (r.c = s.c) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output rs;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; r = R.next();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "rewind" r to first tuple of R where r.c = s.c;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s = S.next();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while (r.c &gt; s.c)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s = S.next();<br>}</pre>
 Refinement: do merging of R &amp; S while merging sort runs from each. 
<ul>
 <li> Requires enough buffers for merging both R and S simultaneously.</li>
 
</ul>
 Note: Sort-merge is symmetric, so "outer", "inner", "left", "right" are arbitrary 
<h3> Classic Hash Join</h3>
 Works for equijoin only 
<p>Let R be the smaller relation </p>
<pre>Hash R into VM;<br>for each tuple of S<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; probe hashtable over R and output all rs s.t. s.c = r.c</pre>
  
<ul>
 <li> In the spirit of indexed nested-loop join, S is "outer" (left), and
R is "inner" (right)</li>
  <li> Warning: at least one important paper calls S the right relation,
R the left!!!</li>
  <li> I prefer to call S left/outer, R right/inner</li>
  
  <ul>
&nbsp; <li> note that hash join is very similar to nested-loop + index-on-the-fly
(which Sybase used to do.)&nbsp; If we call the probing relation there the
"outer", we should do the same here!</li>
 
  </ul>
  <li> Safest to refer to "building" and "probing" relations</li>
 
</ul>
  
<h3> Simple Hash Join</h3>
  
<center><img src="hj1.gif" height="193" width="289">
<img src="hj2.gif" height="193" width="289">
 
<p>Repeat steps 1 and 2 with R, S replaced by the passed over tuples.</p>
</center>
  
<p>Advantages: </p>
<ul>
 <li> Great when R is small</li>
  <li> Works for memory of any size</li>
 
</ul>
 Disadvantages: 
<ul>
 <li> you tell me!</li>
 
</ul>
  
<h3> Grace Hash Join</h3>
  
<center><img src="hj3.gif" height="193" width="289">
</center>
  
<p>Phase 1 is repeated with S in place of R </p>
<p><img src="hj4.gif" height="193" width="289" align="Center">
&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>THEN&nbsp;</b><img src="hj5.gif" height="193" width="289" align="Center">
 </p>
<p>Advantages: </p>
<ul>
 <li> works well for big R, esp. when RAM is just big enough for output buffers 
of R</li>
 
</ul>
 Disadvantages: 
<ul>
 <li> you tell me!</li>
 
</ul>
  
<h3> Hybrid Hash</h3>
 Original paper: DeWitt, Katz, Olken, Shapiro, Stonebraker, Wood, SIGMOD '84. 
<center> 
<p><img src="hj6.gif" height="193" width="289">
 </p>
<p><img src="hj7.gif" height="193" width="289">
</p>
</center>
  
<p>Phase 2 as in Grace Join </p>
<p>Hybrid Hash Advantages: </p>
<ul>
 <li> As good as simple hash for small R</li>
  <li> As good as Grace for big R</li>
  <li> If RAM is bigger than # of output buffers, improves on Grace</li>
 
</ul>
 Disadvantages: 
<ul>
 <li> you tell me</li>
 
</ul>
 Handling Partition Overflow: 
<ul>
 <li> If a partition of R overflows, recursively partition it, along with
the corresponding bucket of S</li>
  <li> Note that size of S does not affect level of recursion!</li>
  
  <ul>
 <li> Makes hash-join particularly effective if |R| &lt;&lt; |S| (compare
to sort-merge)</li>
 
  </ul>
 
</ul>
 Additional Tricks: Filters 
<p>Idea: build a filter based on R so you stage less of S to disk </p>
<ul>
 <li> Babb Array filter</li>
  <li> Bloom filter</li>
  
  <p><br>
These are like lossy semijoins! Any superset of S semijoin R will do.</p>
</ul>
